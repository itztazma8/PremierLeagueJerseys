1.1 Introduction

This website is made for buying premier league jerseys. This is only exclusive to this league. The website contains home and away jerseys for every club in the 23/24 season. Although the relegated teams are not included in the database, all other teams are included with their full information. The details about the specific jerseys have been taken from other established website such as- their respective club websites, Nike and so on. Pictures were taken mostly from Club photo shoot although some were taken from external sites due to the resolution issue. 



1.2 Motive

Currently in Bangladesh, we do not have any established website where people can buy jerseys within a more feasible price. Many want to buy jerseys in wholesale price. This site aims to be exactly like that. The site follows the UK pricing system as an example. If the wholesale stores can open their own websites like this, then the football lovers in our country can buy jerseys in a more suitable price.
